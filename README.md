# Deep Learning for Audio Classification with Python and TensorFlow

A private GitHub repository for the Deep Learning course on Audio Classification using Python and TensorFlow! This repository contains the course slides and a music genre classification project with accompanying code.

## Course Slides

The `slides` directory at the root level of this repository contains all the presentation slides used in the Deep Learning course for Audio Classification. These slides cover various topics related to audio processing, deep learning models, TensorFlow usage, and music genre classification. Feel free to browse through the slides to enhance your understanding of the course material.

## Music Genre Classification Project

Inside the `code` folder, you will find the music genre classification project. This project demonstrates the practical application of the concepts covered in the course. The code is organized in a clear and concise manner to facilitate easy navigation and understanding.

<!-- ### Project Structure

The project code is organized as follows:

- `data`: This directory contains the necessary datasets or instructions to obtain the data required for the music genre classification task.

- `models`: In this directory, you will find TensorFlow model definitions used for audio classification.

- `utils`: This folder includes utility functions and scripts used throughout the project.

- `main.py`: The main Python script to execute the music genre classification pipeline. -->

### Getting Started

To get started with the music genre classification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Ensure you have Python and TensorFlow set up in your environment.

4. Navigate to the `code` directory: `cd code`

5. Explore the datasets and models provided in the respective folders.

6. Run the main script to perform the music genre classification: `python main.py`

### Note on Data

Dataset Used for this project is the [GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
